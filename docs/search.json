Another reason to expect lower growth rates in the Arctic is that capelin, as are many species of fish, are smaller at age at higher latitudes (Chambers and Leggett 1987; Chambers et al. 1989; Olsen et al. 2005)” (Barton et al 2017). On the contrary, juvenile YFS have higher weight at length (growth rate) and higher % lipids in tissue in the NBS subarea relative to the Central and South subareas.\nLower δ¹³C content in NBS suggests an associated with more offshore or pelagic carbon sources (prey), as marine phytoplankton generally have lower δ¹³C values compared to coastal or benthic (bottom-dwelling) primary producers like macroalgae and seagrasses. In contrast, higher δ¹³C values might indicate a diet based on carbon from benthic or coastal sources. It may reflect on their feeding ecology or habitat use."
